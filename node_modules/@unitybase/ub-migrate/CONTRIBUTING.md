# Repository

* Use git flow: https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/index.html
  * `git flow init`
* **Always** write human readable info in `CHANGELOG.md` about changes made in the upcoming versions. 

# JavaScript code

* English:
  * all identifiers, including file names, functions, variables, etc.
  * code comments
* It is ok and encouraged to use EcmaScript 2016, like arrow functions,
  destructuring, etc, where appropriate (server-side code supports it).
* It is too long to describe all the code conventions, just try to follow
  the current style of code, keep code clean, **be consistent**
* **Thoughtful naming** of variables, function names, etc.
* **Keep code clean!**, no commented temp code, no weird comments or weird code, etc.
* Use JSDocs whenever possible and appropriate
